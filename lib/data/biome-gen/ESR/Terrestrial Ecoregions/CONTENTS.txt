## Description
This map depicts the 825 terrestrial ecoregions of the globe.
Ecoregions are relatively large units of land containing distinct
assemblages of natural communities and species, with boundaries that
approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major
land-use change. This comprehensive, global map provides a useful
framework for conducting biogeographical or macroecological research,
for identifying areas of outstanding biodiversity and conservation
priority, for assessing the representation and gaps in conservation
efforts worldwide, and for communicating the global distribution of
natural communities on earth. We have based ecoregion delineations on
hundreds of previous biogeographical studies, and refined and
synthesized existing information in regional workshops over 10 years to
assemble the global dataset. Ecoregions are nested within two
higher-order classifications: biomes (14) and biogeographic realms (8).
Together, these nested classification levels provide a framework for
comparison among units and the identification of representative habitats
and species assemblages. Ecoregions have increasingly been adopted by
research scientists, conservation organizations, and donors as a
framework for analyzing biodiversity patterns, assessing conservation
priorities, and directing effort and support (Ricketts et al. 1999a;
Wikramanayake et al. 2001; Ricketts et al. 1999b; Olson &amp; Dinerstein
1998; Groves et al. 2000; Rosenzweig et al. 2003; and Luck et al. 2003).
More on the approach to ecoregion mapping, the logic and design of the
framework, and previous and potential uses are discusses in
[Olson et al. (2001)](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/11/933/227116?login=false)
and Ricketts et al. (1999a).

### Attribute Data

AREA    AREA    Area of each individual polygon in square kilometers.  The attribute area_km2 is a sum of this field for each ecoregion as a whole.    
area_km2    area_km2    Area of the Ecoregion (km2)    
BIOME    BIOME    Biome    
BIOME_1    BIOME_1    Biome - LABEL    
eco_code    eco_code    This is an alphanumeric code that is similar to eco_ID but a little easier to interpret.  The first 2 characters (letters) are the realm the ecoregion is in.  The 2nd 2 characters are the biome and the last 2 characters are the ecoregion number.    
ECO_ID    ECO_ID    This number is created by combining REALM, BIOME, and ECO_NUM, thus creating a unique numeric ID for each ecoregion.    
ECO_NAME    ECO_NAME    Ecoregion Name    
ECO_NUM    ECO_NUM    A unique number for each ecoregion within each biome nested within each realm.    
ECO_SYM    ECO_SYM    Ecoregion Symbol - Used to display the map in ArcInfo    
FID    FID    None    
G200_BIOME    G200_BIOME    Global 200 Biome - The biome of the Global 200 region that the ecoregion is a component of. Occasionally a Global 200 region is made up of ecoregions of different biomes. In this case, for a particular ecoregion, the G200_BIOME may be different from the original biome. For a description of each Global 200 biome (1-14), see BIOME.    
G200_NUM    G200_NUM    Global 200 Number    
G200_REGIO    G200_REGIO    Global 200 Name    
G200_STAT    G200_STAT    Global 200 Conservation status    
REALM_1    G200_STAT_    Biogeographical Realm - LABEL    
GBL_STAT    GBL_STAT    Global Status    
G200_STAT_    GBL_STAT_1        
OBJECTID    OBJECTID    Internal feature number.    
PERIMETER    PERIMETER        
REALM    REALM    Biogeographical Realm
